Decision-making has always been crucial to an organization’s performance and the ability to outperform competitors.  As time has passed, numerous successes and failures have depended on key decisions, creating immense pressure on decision-makers to make smart and prompt choices.

The source explained that the focus has varied a lot to achieve the best result, and a lot of time throughout the 20th century has been spent on researching subjects such as mathematics, sociology, psychology, economics, and political science. Further, the source states that researchers have explored how decisions reflect human values and ways to enhance them, resulting in deeper insights into human behavior, improved decision support tools, and ultimately more effective decision-making across different situations.

Studies have been conducted since the mid-20th century where researchers have explored the possibility of decision systems that combined human judgment with machines’ predictive capabilities, triggering interest in trying to improve the decision-making process through technology, data, and analytics. Data-driven decision-making has become more appealing since the rise of data science and machine learning. Combining human intuition with data analysis leads to more logical and successful results, according to the source.

The source explains that by combining artificial intelligence (AI) and human intelligence decision-making, many organizations have become motivated to boost their combined intelligence and capabilities, which can result in smarter data analysis and better decision-making support. But the challenging part is to make full use of the data, tools, and insights available without clear guidelines, underling the importance of ongoing research. 

\section{Problem Statement}

With the increase in the field of decision-making by organizations, therefore the integration of data and analytics has become a crucial part of increasing performance and competitive edge. Unfortunately, despite the rich history that exists when it comes to decision theory, and the rise of the importance of big data and analytics, there are still gaps in both research and practice when it comes to a cohesive framework that can combine traditional decision-making elements with modern data-driven insights effectively. The gap becomes clearer when you take into consideration the mixed results that were retrieved from the attempts made by different organizations when it comes to implementing data-driven decision-making strategies. A small percentage of organizations use improvements to make better decisions. While others face problems because they do not fully understand how to use these tools or to combine the elements of humans and machines.

The current decision theories that are used fail to offer guidance on how to integrate big data and advanced analytics with human decision-making processes. This leads to models not fully utilizing the potential of data-driven insights to improve the quality of decisions. With the information provided, it becomes clearer that there is a need for a new theory that recognizes big data and analytics as separate parts and also offers a way to combine it with the human aspect to improve the decision-making process.

The study aims to evaluate DECAS which is a modern data-driven decision theory. DECAS builds on classical decision theory, adding big data and analytics as key elements to the existing framework of decision-making processes, decision-makers, and the decisions themselves.The research aims to investigate how DECAS serves as a complete framework that allows organizations to use the full range of data-driven capabilities to make well-informed, improved, and impactful decisions. In doing this, it aims to contribute to both the theory and practice of computer science, especially in the area of organizational decision-making.
