\section{Data Colllection}

\section{Data Analysis}
Currently, we have two options when it comes to implementing and analyzing data we will collect, we could either use Python or normal HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The authors are both experienced in both options. 
If we were to use Python, the data collected would be stored in MariaDB which is a branch of MySQL. When it comes to database operations, we will use SQLAlchemy or Djangos Object-relational Mapper (ORM). The backend will use Flask or Django to create API endpoints to interact with MariaDB.
Python libraries such as Scikit-learn or TensorFlow will be used to develop prediction algorithms. The backend can process data fetched from MariaDB, apply the prediction model, and send results to the frontend.
When it comes to the feedback mechanism, API endpoints will be implemented to receive user feedback on predictions, which can be used to refine the model.
